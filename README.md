# Python-Cs1-graphics
Python Cs1 graphics is a library made for python 2 to create graphics.

This mini-project was given to me on my Freshman year at Adama Science and Technology University (**ASTU**).

I have made a little animation of an airport scene while the planes takes off and goes back down.

**How to use**
In order to run it, first you need to install Python 2. Then to get the Cs1 graphics libraries and other related libraries contact me at mu.shams833@gmail.com
